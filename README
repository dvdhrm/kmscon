= KMSCON =
Kmscon is a simple terminal emulator based on linux kernel mode setting (KMS).
It is an attempt to replace the in-kernel VT implementation with a userspace
console.

== Requirements ==
  Kmscon requires the following software:
    - libdrm: accessing the kernel graphics layer
    - mesa: providing an OpenGL implementation (must be compiled with EGL, gbm
            and GL libraries)
    - udev: providing input device hotplug
    - libxkbcommon: keyboard handling
    - glib: only for Unicode handling
    - One of:
      - freetype2: drawing generic text
      - pango: drawing text with pango (use --enable-pango)
               Pango requires: glib, cairo, pangocairo, pango and freetype2

== Install ==
  To compile the kmscon binary, run the standard autotools commands:
    $ ./configure [--enable-debug] [--enable-pango]
    $ make
    $ make install
  To compile the test applications, run:
    $ make check

== FAQ ==
  === Why didn't you use libvte or similar terminal emulators? ===
  All existing terminal emulators I found highly depend on X. Also, their code
  base often is a horrible mess. I haven't had the time to convert them to use
  other drawing functions than Xlib, yet.
  If you feel like doing this work, please notify me. I would be glad to adjust
  my code to work with other terminal emulators.

== Code Base ==
  The kmscon code is split into several independent subsystems:
    - output:
      This code manages the KMS/DRI output and provides OpenGL framebuffers.
    - console:
      This draws the text on the screen and provides an API for any terminal
      emulator to visualize its contents.
    - eloop:
      Main loop implementation.
    - log:
      Log file handling.
    - unicode:
      Provides basic Unicode handling.
    - font:
      Font loading, caching and drawing operations.
    - input:
      All linux input events are captured here and converted to Unicode
      characters for input handling.
    - vt:
      The linux VT subsystem integration. This allows to run the application in
      a classic linux VT like X does.
    - vte:
      The terminal emulator library.
    - terminal:
      Connects the console, output, input and vte handling into a real terminal.
    - main:
      This connects all subsystems into a usable console application.
