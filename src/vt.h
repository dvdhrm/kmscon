/*
 * VT compatibility
 * If the kmscon application runs in a VT we need to react on VT switch events
 * to allow other applications to access the DRM. This is only needed as long as
 * we run in a VT. In the future we will be able to disable all VTs and run as
 * service daemon. We then need another way to switch between graphical
 * applications, though.
