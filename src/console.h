/*
 * Console Management
 * The console management uses OpenGL, cairo and pango to draw a console to a
 * framebuffer. It is independent of the other subsystems and can also be used
 * in other applications.
 *
 * This console does not emulate any terminal at all. This subsystem just
 * provides functions to draw a console to a framebuffer and modifying the state
 * of it.
